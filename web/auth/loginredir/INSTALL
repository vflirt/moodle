Hello moodle user,

In the instructions below, MOODLE_HOME is the path to where your Moodle is
deployed in your server.

To install this plugin:

1- Upload/unpack everything under:
MOODLE_HOME/auth/loginredir

NOTE 1: You have to create the 'loginredir' folder.

NOTE 2: if the package you got the files from put them within a folder of its own,
remove the files from that folder. For example, there should *NOT* be a "moodle-auth_loginredir"
folder under "MOODLE_HOME/auth/loginredir".

2- Login to Moodle with your admin account.

3- Go to:
Site Administration --> Plugins --> Authentication --> Manage Authentication

4- Enable "Login user redirection".

5- Save changes

6- Try it out!
